    <h1>Just another developer / filmmaker / webdesigner ðŸŒ™</h1>
    <p>
      My name is <a href="https://raphaelbernhart.at" target="_blank">Raphael</a> and I'm just another Web-Dude with a passion for film. Nah forreal I love watching and especially creating videos. To hold balance in my life I'm also a really passionate skierðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡¹. Even tho I'm totally a winter guy in the summertime there is no way around football(The real one âš½).

    At the moment I'm particularly interested into learning as much as possible about "The Cloud ðŸ‘½". Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything as long as it makes fun.
